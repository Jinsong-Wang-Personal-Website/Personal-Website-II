        <p> A web crawler bot is like someone who goes through all the books in a disorganized library and puts together a card catalog so that anyone who visits the library can quickly and easily find the information they need. To help categorize and sort the library's books by topic, the organizer will read the title, summary, and some of the internal text of each book to figure out what it's about.
        </p>

            A web crawler is a software program that systematically visits web pages and collects information from them. Web crawlers are used for various purposes, such as indexing websites for search engines, archiving web content, analyzing web data, or scraping web data for specific needs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Web crawlers typically follow a set of rules or policies to determine which pages to visit, how often to visit them, and how to extract and store the information from them. Some of the challenges that web crawlers face include dealing with dynamic web pages, avoiding duplicate content, respecting robots.txt files, and handling ethical and legal issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Web crawlers are also known as web spiders, web robots, bots, and automatic indexers.
