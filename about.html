                Kamado Joe Classic III may have a steep price, but it delivers plenty for the money. That means lots of kamado
                grilling accessories that don't come standard with other grills, including the Big Green Egg Kamado. This kamado
                grill and smoker performs well too. In our slow-and-low barbecue grill test, we adjust grills to 225 F (107 C) and
                let go of the controls to see what happens. In this trial, the Kamado Joe Classic III demonstrated excellent
                temperature control. It held steady at 225 F for 3 hours, 15 minutes, and then dropped to 220 F for 30 minutes.

                Texas barbecue is a style of cooking meat that originated in the Lone Star State and has become popular across the country and around the world. Texas barbecue is characterized by the use of beef, especially brisket, as the main meat, and by the application of a dry rub and a sauce that are typically spicy and tangy. Texas barbecue is cooked over low and slow heat, usually using wood or charcoal as the fuel source. The result is a tender, juicy, and flavorful meat that can be sliced or chopped and served on a plate or a sandwich.

                There are four main regional styles of Texas barbecue: Central Texas, East Texas, West Texas, and South Texas. Each style has its own variations and preferences for the type of meat, rub, sauce, and wood used. Central Texas barbecue is influenced by German and Czech immigrants who brought their meat-smoking techniques to the area. It focuses on brisket, ribs, and sausage, seasoned with a simple salt and pepper rub and smoked over oak or pecan wood. The sauce is usually thin and vinegar-based, and served on the side. East Texas barbecue is influenced by African American and Southern traditions. It features pork as well as beef, marinated with a sweet and tomato-based sauce and cooked over hickory or mesquite wood. The meat is chopped and mixed with more sauce before serving. West Texas barbecue is influenced by cowboy and ranching culture. It uses goat and mutton as well as beef, rubbed with spices and cooked over direct heat from mesquite coals. The sauce is thick and tomato-based, and often contains chili peppers. South Texas barbecue is influenced by Mexican cuisine. It uses barbacoa (cow head) and cabrito (young goat) as well as beef, seasoned with a dry rub or a wet marinade and cooked in a pit lined with leaves or wrapped in foil. The sauce is thin and spicy, and often contains citrus juice or vinegar.
